# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish the current application version without any functional or UI changes.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new production build from the current codebase state.
- Deploy/publish the build and verify it loads successfully.

**User-visible outcome:** The latest deployment is available in the browser with all existing functionality unchanged (including transaction deletion with a confirmation dialog).
